# Generative AI

Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content—such as text, images, audio, or code—by learning patterns from existing data. Instead of just analyzing or predicting, it generates original outputs that resemble real data.

Popular models like GPT (for text) and DALL·E or Stable Diffusion (for images) are examples of generative AI in action.

It is widely used in content creation, design, automation, personalization, and even healthcare research, making it one of the most innovative and fast-growing areas in AI.
